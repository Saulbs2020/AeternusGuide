** Initial Setup**
1. Download and open the file
2. Publish to roblox
3. In File > Game Settings, enable the following settings:
  - Security > Allow HTTP requests
  - Security > Enable studio access to API services
  - Security > Allow Third Party Teleports (OPTIONAL, ITS FOR THIS ONE ADMIN COMMAND)
4. In File > Avatar Settings, enable to following settings:
  - Three dots (top right corner) > R6 Only
5. You can spoof animations as you like, but personally I use this program: <https://github.com/kartFr/Asset-Reuploader/releases>. If you plan on using a different method, you can skip the next steps.
6. Download the latest version for your device, and install it.
7. Download the .rbxm file in the latest version, drag it into roblox studio, right click on the imported folder, and click Save/Export > Save as local plugin
8. Find the new plugin in your plugins tab, and enable the following settings:
  - Filter > Search scripts
  - Filter > Search int/number values
  - Filter > Search string values
  - Filter > Place Id > Input 117882128313801 and click the plus button, then input 18687417158 and click the plus button again.
-#     - IF THE ANIMATION SPOOFER FAILS TO CONNECT TO LOCALHOST, TRY SETTING THE PORT TO 38073 IN SETTINGS TAB
9. Open the app you downloaded in step 6, and you can begin using the plugin to spoof your animations! Once you click reupload, you may have to wait a few minutes for the reuploading to start. It's annoying, but you just have to deal with it. Repeat the process until most are spoofed.
10. For animations that cannot be spoofed, or sounds, you may have to resort to a manual spoofing method. For this, I use <@1443777170253287476> (type /download in <#1430856535415722034> ) or [privateassetdownloader](<https://github.com/ClaytonTDM/robloxAssetDownloader/releases>), which runs locally and does not require your main account's cookie (you can use an alt).
