Making Custom Abilities

In order to make your own abilities for a custom survivor.
Make sure you already have a survivor in replicated storage and their rig inside of server storage.
If not then duplicate a survivor folder that has behavior and config and just put your rig inside of serverstorage - assets - survivors (YOUR SURVIVOR FOLDER)

We'll be using this code to make an ability:

["Template"] = {
	LayoutOrder = 99,
	Icon = "rbxassetid://0",
	KeybindType = "AltAbility1",
	Cooldown = 0,
	Callback = function(actor)
		local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

		if RunService:IsServer() then
			actor.AbilitiesDisabled = true

			task.delay(0, function()
				
			end)

			actor.AbilitiesDisabled = false

		else
			
		end
	end
},

MAKING A STUNNING/DAMAGE ABILITY
In order to make an ability have a hitbox you'll be needing this:
			task.delay(0.3, function()

				require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Modules.Hitboxes):CreateHitbox(actor.Player, {
					Size = Vector3.new(6,5,6),
					CFrame = actor.Rig:GetPivot(),
					CFrameOffset = CFrame.new(0,0,-3),
					Time = 0.2,
					Knockback = 4,
					HitMultiple = true,
					Damage = 25
					Connections = {
						Hit = function(target)
							
						end
					}
				})

			end)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - This code is used to generate the hitbox, you may find the hitbox module through
ReplicatedStorage - Modules - Hitboxes.
require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Modules.Hitboxes):CreateHitbox(actor.Player, {
 - After adding this line of code, make sure to add this:
Size = Vector3.new(6,5,6),
CFrame = actor.Rig:GetPivot(),
CFrameOffset = CFrame.new(0,0,-3),
Time = 0.2,
Knockback = 4,
HitMultiple = true,
Damage = 20,
	Connections = {
		Hit = function(target)
							
				end
			}

Size - The size of your ability hitbox
CFrame - Where the hitbox will be generated at (DO NOT TOUCH THIS)
CFrameOffset = Offset position of your hitbox. (Depending on your ability, you can adjust this)
Time = The amount of time the hitbox will stay generated.
Knockback = The amount of knockback the ability gives.. thats it.
HitMultiple = Self explanatory, gives the hitbox the ability to hit more than 1 player.
Damage = How much damage the hitbox does to a player.

EXTRA:
Friendlyfire = Enables the ability to hit players in your team, (Killer or Survivor)
ExecuteOnKill = (KILLER ONLY) When a player is low, if your killer has execution anims it will play the execution animation.
