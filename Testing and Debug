Testing and Debug (Info comes from https://discord.com/channels/1387670662264651927/1420642876823703584 )
## Enabling and Disabling testing mode
1. Click on the workspace in your explorer.
2. In your properties tab, scroll down until you see "Testing". You can toggle this on or off.
## Enabling and Disabling free testing
1. Go to game.ServerStorage.AeternusConfig
2. You can set FreeTesting to true or false.
## Chat Commands
1. The !actor command, partially taken from Codename Redux so shoutout to them, summons a fake actor in the format: !actor ActorName ActorType Quantity(Optional) SkinName(Optional)
2. The !kill command kills all characters on a certain team. Example: !kill Survivors
## Additional
1. There's also a command called "Open Testing Server" for developers and above which opens up a testing server ingame.
2. Outside of runtime, you can store StudioAssets directly inside of workspace (destroys on runtime if not testing, still a little unsafe), OR you can take the safer route and store it in game.ServerStorage.Miscellaneous
