# Making your own skin
In order to make a skin for a certain character,go to ReplicatedStorage, Assets, Skins,Killer/Survivor, and then select the character you want to add a skin for.
Copy any of their skins, then rename it to what you'd like EXAMPLE: TestNoob
After renaming your skin, go to their config.
You will probably see this:
local v1 = {
 ["DisplayName"] = "ClassicNoob",
["Description"] = "2009",
["RenderImage"] = "rbxassetid://8381911105954",
["Price"] = "200",
}

return v1
    
DisplayName is the name of your skin that will be displayed in the shop and inventory
Description is the description of your skin.. yeah.
RenderImage is the render of your skin, if you have no render for a skin you can simply just set RenderImage to:
 ["RenderImage"] = nil
Price is the price of your skin, you can set it to any number you want as long as its not negative!
