Aeternus Group Rank customization (Info comes from https://discord.com/channels/1387670662264651927/1420638064216244244 )
# This tutorial showcases customization of ranks/permissions for both user-owned AND group-owned games!
## Customizing ranks
### User-owned
1. To customize ranks and permissions for specific people, go to game.ServerStorage.AeternusConfig.
2. Open the module and look for "ManualRanks". here you can add a player's user ID, and assign them a rank based on the rank names in game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.RankNames (REMOVE THE PREVIOUS ONES I FORGOT TO 😭)
### Group-owned
1. Go to your group, configure community, and go to the roles tab.
2. Ensure that your role's ranks match the permissions at the bottom of this tutorial, and adjust if needed.
  - As an alternative, check out the additional section further down in this tutorial, at number 1.
3. An additional setting you can adjust in game.ServerStorage.AeternusConfig is "PreferCustomRankNames". The comment there explains it to you.
## Additional
1. You can change these rank requirements for commands in game.ServerScriptService.Server.Modules.Commands or change the rank translations in game.ReplicatedStorage.Modules.Schematics.GroupRankTranslations
2. You can assign custom titles to specific users in game.ServerStorage.AeternusConfig.
3. Here are the default Aeternus rank command permissions:
  - Rank 10 or above: Tester (access to game even if freetesting is off)
  - Rank 100 or above: Moderator (basic moderator commands such as banning and unbanning)
  - Rank 150 or above: Head Moderator (more dangerous moderator commands such as giving levels, money, malice, skins, global announcements, etc.)
  - Rank 200 or above: Developer (access to testing commands such as open testing server or set server type)
